    <h2>Titanic Prediction</h2>

    <h4>Fill in the details to create virtual pasenger.</h4>
    <p>We will predict would virtual passenger <b>survive or not,</b> with help of different machine learning models.</p>

    <p><b>Variable Notes</b><br>
        pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br>
        1st = Upper<br>
        2nd = Middle<br>
        3rd = Lower<br>
        <br>
        age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5<br>
        <br>
        sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>
        Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br>
        Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)<br>

        parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...<br>
        Parent = mother, father<br>
        Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br>
        Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.<br>
